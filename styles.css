/* Your CSS Code here. */There should be a textbox with id="evaluatedText" and an h3 tag with id="letterCount". The h3 renders the calculated letter count of the text in the textbox. The letters should be counted in realtime, i.e., when users update the text in the textbox, the h3 should also update the letter count displayed. If there's no text, it should display 0.
